<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Something about myself I would consider interesting 
    would be the time I went sky diving for the first 
    time. I was visiting my cousin in-law in Delaware 
    and we decided to do something crazy and went sky 
    diving. The flight prepping for the day went well 
    and we got in the air just fine. The routine check 
    of the parachutes was done as well but when we tried 
    to use it it didn't work, I thought I was going to die 
    but the company always packs a second safety chute and 
    we used that at the last minute. Really freaky moment 
    though.
</p>

<p>
    Another interesting about me would be another incident 
    that happened when I was much younger. I was around 2 
    years old and we had just came here from India, living 
    in an apartment. My mom had gone to take a shower and left 
    me watching tv, now I was a very mischievous baby so I was 
    prone to doing this. I got a key from the coffee table and 
    stuck it inside of an electrical outlet across the room, 
    the outlet short-circuited and basically blew the wall up 
    while I was standing there crying.
