<h1> Assignment 3</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p> The goal of this assignment was to style 3 different websites using just CSS with the same HTML code, we could not edit the HTML code.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Version 1</h2>
<p>
This version of the website was just kind of my first take with working with CSS. 
I did the basics: added a background, aligned the text, and changed the font. 
I added a banner to house the page title and gave each poem/pic combo and border. 
Lastly I just added a little animation to make everything fade in when the
website loads.

<li><a href="http://sony_bp.mmm.cs.mercer.edu/A3/Version1" target="_blank">Version 1 Link</a></li>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Verison 2</h2>
<p>
The second version of the website I went with experimenting gradients and animations. 
I looked at some simple gradients and chose some colors that sort of went with each poem. 
I guess this would be called an animation but what it basically does is each background
fades from one color to another that I have set.

</div>

<div>
<h2>Version 3</h2>
<p>
The third version of the website I really did not have any outstanding ideas so I just 
played with gradiets and tried to see how I could change up the same gradient.
